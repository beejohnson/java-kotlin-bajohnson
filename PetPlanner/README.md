This application is my final project for my advanced Java/Kotlin class at Colorado Mesa University.

I created this app to solve a problem I'm sure some people struggle with- reminding yourself to feed
your animals on time. My pets are very specific about their feeding times; if I'm even slightly late
I won't hear the end of it. This app is for the express purpose of being able to set an alarm that 
will remind you to feed your pets..

The pixelart displayed in the app was created by me, using a program called 'aseprite'

Throughout my time creating this project, I used two different websites that had helpful tutorials 
in understanding android studios better.
The first was https://developer.android.com/courses/fundamentals-training/toc-v2 which has some
in-depth tutorials on basic app creation. It helped me to understand how displays work, and how
best to begin my app.
Another source I used was an article at https://javapapers.com/android/android-alarm-clock-tutorial/
which helped me understand how to properly create an alarm clock function within my app.
