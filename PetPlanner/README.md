This application was created to be turned in as my final project for my advanced Java/Kotlin class.

The basic idea is that this app will help remind owners to feed their pets, as well as making it 
easy to remind yourself of upcoming vet appointments/birthdays of your pets.

The pixelart displayed in the app was created by me, using a program called 'aseprite'

Throughout my time creating this project, I used two different websites that had helpful tutorials 
in understanding android studios betters.
The first was https://developer.android.com/courses/fundamentals-training/toc-v2 which has some
in-depth tutorials on basic app creation. It helped me to understand how displays work, and how
best to begin my app.

Another source I used was an article at https://javapapers.com/android/android-alarm-clock-tutorial/
which helped me understand how to properly create an alarm clock function within my app.
